    And API Operator create new route using data below:
      | createRouteRequest | { "zoneId":{zone-id}, "hubId":{hub-id}, "vehicleId":{vehicle-id}, "driverId":{ninja-driver-id} } |
    And API Operator create new shipper address V2 using data below:
      | shipperId       | {shipper-v4-id} |
      | generateAddress | RANDOM          |
    And API Operator create V2 reservation using data below:
      | reservationRequest | { "legacy_shipper_id":{shipper-v4-legacy-id}, "pickup_approx_volume":"Less than 10 Parcels", "pickup_start_time":"{gradle-current-date-yyyy-MM-dd}T15:00:00{gradle-timezone-XXX}", "pickup_end_time":"{gradle-current-date-yyyy-MM-dd}T18:00:00{gradle-timezone-XXX}" } |
    And API Operator add reservation pick-up to the route
