      | generateFromAndTo | RANDOM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
      | v4OrderRequest    | { "service_type":"Marketplace Sort","requested_tracking_number":"RBS{{6-random-digits}}","sort":{"to_3pl":"ROADBULL"},"marketplace":{"seller_id": "seller-ABC01","seller_company_name":"ABC Shop"},"service_level":"Standard", "parcel_job":{ "is_pickup_required":false, "pickup_date":"{{next-1-day-yyyy-MM-dd}}", "pickup_timeslot":{ "start_time":"12:00", "end_time":"15:00"}, "delivery_start_date":"{{next-1-day-yyyy-MM-dd}}", "delivery_timeslot":{ "start_time":"09:00", "end_time":"22:00"}}} |
    And API Operator creates new Route Groups Filter Template using data below:
      | name                   | PRESET {gradle-current-date-yyyyMMddHHmmsss} |
      | value.masterShipperIds | {shipper-v4-marketplace-sort-legacy-id}      |
      | value.showTransaction  | true                                         |
      | value.showReservation  | true                                         |
    When Operator go to menu Routing -> 1.1. Create Route Groups V1.5
    And Operator selects "{KEY_CREATE_ROUTE_GROUPS_FILTERS_PRESET_NAME}" Filter Preset on Create Route Group V1.5 page
    And Operator click Load Selection on Create Route Group V1.5 page
    Then Operator verifies Transaction records on Create Route Group V1.5 page using data below:
      | trackingId                                | type                 | shipper                                 | address                                                    | status         |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[1].trackingId} | PICKUP Transaction   | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[1].fromName} | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[1].buildShortFromAddressString} | Pending Pickup |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[1].trackingId} | DELIVERY Transaction | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[1].fromName} | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[1].buildShortToAddressString}   | Pending Pickup |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[2].trackingId} | PICKUP Transaction   | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[2].fromName} | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[2].buildShortFromAddressString} | Pending Pickup |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[2].trackingId} | DELIVERY Transaction | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[2].fromName} | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER[2].buildShortToAddressString}   | Pending Pickup |
