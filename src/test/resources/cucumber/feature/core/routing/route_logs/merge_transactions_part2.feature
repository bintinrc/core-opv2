      | createRouteRequest | { "zoneId":{zone-id}, "hubId":{hub-id}, "vehicleId":{vehicle-id}, "driverId":{ninja-driver-id} } |
    And API Operator add multiple parcels to the route using data below:
      | addParcelToRouteRequest | { "type":"<type>" } |
    When Operator go to menu Routing -> Route Logs
    And Operator set filter using data below and click 'Load Selection'
      | routeDateFrom | {gradle-current-date-dd/MM/yyyy} |

      | hubName       | {hub-name}                       |
    And API Operator get multiple order details by saved Order ID
    And API Operator gets "Delivery" transaction waypoint ids of created orders
    When Operator merge transactions of created routes
    And API Operator get order details
    Then Operator verifies that success react notification displayed:
      | top    | Transactions with 1 routes merged       |
      | bottom | Route {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ROUTE_ID[1]} |
    And API Operator get order details
    And API Operator verifies <transaction_type> transactions of following orders have same waypoint id:
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[1]} |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[2]} |
    And Operator save the last DELIVERY transaction of "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[1]}" order as "KEY_TRANSACTION_AFTER"
    And DB Operator verifies waypoints record:
      | id      | {KEY_TRANSACTION_AFTER.waypointId} |
      | status  | Routed                             |

      | seqNo   | null                               |

    And DB Operator verifies route_monitoring_data record:
      | waypointId | {KEY_TRANSACTION_AFTER.waypointId} |
      | routeId    | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ROUTE_ID[1]}  |
    And API Operator gets orphaned "Delivery" transaction waypoint ids of created orders
    And DB Operator verifies all orphaned route_monitoring_data is hard-deleted

    Examples:
      | transaction_type | type | service_type | direction | generateAddress | email_1       | email_2       | phone_number_1 | phone_number_2 | is_pickup_required |
      | Delivery         | DD   | Parcel       | to        | generateFrom    | binti@test.co | binti@test.co | +6595557073    | +6595557073    | false              |
