Feature: Stamp Disassociation

  Background:
    Given Launch browser
    Given Operator login with username = "{operator-portal-uid}" and password = "{operator-portal-pwd}"

  Scenario: Operator Should not be Able to Disassociate Order that Has no Stamp ID
    Given API Shipper create V4 order using data below:
      | generateFromAndTo | RANDOM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

    When Operator go to menu New Features -> Stamp Disassociation
    And Operator enters "{KEY_CREATED_ORDER_TRACKING_ID}" value into 'Scan Stamp ID' field on Stamp Disassociation page
    Then Operator verify the label says "stamp id not available" on Stamp Disassociation page
    Then Operator verify order details on Stamp Disassociation page

  Scenario: Stamp Disassociation of Order by Stamp Id - Invalid Stamp Id
    Given Operator go to menu Shipper Support -> Blocked Dates
    Given API Shipper create V4 order using data below:
      | generateFromAndTo | RANDOM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

    When Operator go to menu New Features -> Stamp Disassociation
    And Operator enters "INVALID_STAMP_ID" value into 'Scan Stamp ID' field on Stamp Disassociation page
    Then Operator will get the Not Found alert on Stamp Disassociation page

  Scenario: Stamp Disassociation of Order by Stamp Id - Valid Stamp Id
    Given Operator go to menu Shipper Support -> Blocked Dates
    Given New Stamp ID was generated
    And API Shipper create V4 order using data below:
