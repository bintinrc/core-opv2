  Scenario Outline: Publish Dimension Value and Device Source on Hub Inbound Event with No Updated Dimension or Size - Device Type = DWS
    Given API Shipper create V4 order using data below:
      | generateFromAndTo | RANDOM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
      | v4OrderRequest    | { "service_type":"Parcel", "service_level":"Standard", "parcel_job":{"dimensions":{"weight":<oldWeight>,"height":<oldHeight>,"length":<oldLength>,"width":<oldWidth>,"size":"<oldSizeShort>"}, "is_pickup_required":false, "pickup_date":"{{next-1-day-yyyy-MM-dd}}", "pickup_timeslot":{ "start_time":"12:00", "end_time":"15:00"}, "delivery_start_date":"{{next-1-day-yyyy-MM-dd}}", "delivery_timeslot":{ "start_time":"09:00", "end_time":"22:00"}}} |
    And API Operator global inbounds the order belongs to specific Hub Inbound User:
      | jsonRequest | {"barcodes":["{KEY_CREATED_ORDER_TRACKING_ID}"],"weight":{"value":null},"dimensions":{"l":null,"w":null,"h":null},"hub_id":{hub-id}} |
    When Operator open Edit Order page for order ID "{KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ID}"
    Then Operator verify order status is "Transit" on Edit Order page
    And Operator verify order granular status is "Arrived At Sorting Hub" on Edit Order page
    Then Operator verifies dimensions information on Edit Order page:
      | weight | <oldWeight> |
      | height | <oldHeight> |
      | length | <oldLength> |
      | width  | <oldWidth>  |
      | size   | <oldSize>   |
    And Operator verify order event on Edit order page using data below:
