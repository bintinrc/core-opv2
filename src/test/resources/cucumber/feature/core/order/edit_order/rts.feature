      | top                | 1 order(s) RTS-ed |
      | waitUntilInvisible | true              |
    And Operator verifies RTS tag is displayed in delivery details box on Edit Order page
    Then Operator verify order events on Edit order page using data below:
      | name                       |
      | RTS                        |
      | UPDATE ADDRESS             |
      | UPDATE CONTACT INFORMATION |
      | UPDATE AV                  |
    And Operator verify order status is "Transit" on Edit Order page
    And Operator verify order granular status is "Arrived at Sorting Hub" on Edit Order page
    When API Operator get order details
    When API Operator get order details
    When Operator save the last Delivery transaction of the created order as "KEY_TRANSACTION"
    Then DB Operator verifies transactions record:
      | orderId    | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ID}                    |
      | waypointId | {KEY_TRANSACTION.waypointId}              |
      | type       | DD                                        |
      | status     | Pending                                   |
      | routeId    | null                                      |
      | address1   | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromAddress1} |
      | address2   | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromAddress2} |
      | postcode   | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromPostcode} |
      | city       | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromCity}     |
      | country    | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromCountry}  |
    And DB Operator verifies waypoints record:
      | id       | {KEY_TRANSACTION.waypointId}              |
      | status   | Pending                                   |
      | routeId  | null                                      |
      | seqNo    | null                                      |
      | address1 | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromAddress1} |
      | address2 | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromAddress2} |
      | postcode | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromPostcode} |
      | city     | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromCity}     |
      | country  | {KEY_CREATED_ORDER_ORIGINAL.fromCountry}  |
    When DB Operator gets "{KEY_TRANSACTION.waypointId}" waypoint record
    And API Operator get Addressing Zone from a lat long with type "RTS"
    Then Operator verifies Zone is correct after RTS on Edit Order page
    And Operator verifies waypoints.routing_zone_id is correct
