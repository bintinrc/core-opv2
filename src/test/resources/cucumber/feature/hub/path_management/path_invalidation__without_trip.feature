    And DB Operator verify sla in movement_events table is "FAILED" no path for the following shipments from "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id}" to "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}":
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_SHIPMENT_IDS[2]} |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_SHIPMENT_IDS[5]} |
    Given Operator refresh page
    When Operator search Hub on page Hubs Administration using data below:
      | searchHubsKeyword | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].name} |
    And Operator update Hub column "lat/long" with data:
      | latitude  | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].latitude}  |
      | longitude | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].longitude} |
    Given API Operator create new "CROSSDOCK" movement schedule with type "LAND_HAUL" from hub id = {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id} to hub id = {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}
    And API Operator create new "CROSSDOCK" movement schedule with type "AIR_HAUL" from hub id = {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id} to hub id = {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}
    When API Operator does the "van-inbound" scan from "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id}" to "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}" for the following shipments:
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_SHIPMENT_IDS[3]} |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_SHIPMENT_IDS[6]} |
    And DB Operator verifies "default" path with origin "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id}" and "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}" with type "LAND_HAUL" is created in movement_path table
    Then DB Operator verifies "default" path with origin "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id}" and "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}" with type "AIR_HAUL" is created in movement_path table
    And DB Operator verifies number of path with origin "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[1].id}" and "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_HUBS[2].id}" is 2 in movement_path table
