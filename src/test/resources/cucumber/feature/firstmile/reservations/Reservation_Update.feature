    And Operator clicks on the "Update Addresses Lat Long" button to upload CSV file
    And Operator uploads csv file: "Update_Address_Lat_Long.csv" by browsing files in "Update Addresses Lat Long" upload window
    Then Operator verifies upload success message is displayed for success count "1"
    And Operator filter the column "Address ID" with "{KEY_CREATED_SHIPPER_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_LATLONG[1]}"
    Then Operator verifies table is filtered "lat_long" based on input in "50.5,50.5" in shipper address page
    Then Operator verifies that green check mark icon is shown under the Lat Long
    Then DB Core - verifies that zone type is equal to "FIRST_MILE" and zone id is not null for waypointId "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_RESERVATIONS[1].waypointId}"
    Then DB Core - verifies that latitude is equal to "50.5" and longitude is equal to "50.5" and for waypointId "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_RESERVATIONS[1].waypointId}"
