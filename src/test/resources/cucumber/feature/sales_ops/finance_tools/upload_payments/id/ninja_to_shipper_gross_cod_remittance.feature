  Scenario Outline: 1 Account ID linked 1 Shipper - Payment via CSV Upload with Shipper ID for COD Transaction Event Type "Gross COD Remittance" with exact amount of Total Adjusted COD - Input Remittance Type with Lowercase - ID
    Given API Operator create new 'normal' shipper
    And API Operator send below request to addPricingProfile endpoint for Shipper ID "{KEY_SHIPPER_ID}"
      | {"shipper_id": "{KEY_SHIPPER_ID}","effective_date":"{gradle-next-0-day-yyyy-MM-dd}T00:00:00Z","comments": null,"pricing_script_id": {pricing-script-id-all},"pricing_levers": {"cod_min_fee": 50,"cod_percentage": 0.8,"insurance_min_fee": 2,"insurance_percentage": 0.6,"insurance_threshold": 25}} |
    And API Shipper set Shipper V4 using data below:
      | legacyId | {KEY_LEGACY_SHIPPER_ID} |
    And DB operator inserts below data to billing_qa_gl.shipper_accounts table
      | shipper_id      | {KEY_SHIPPER_ID} |
      | source          | <source>         |

      | overall_balance | 0.00             |
    Given API Shipper create multiple V4 orders using data below:

    And API Operator Global Inbound parcel using data below:
      | globalInboundRequest | { "hubId":{hub-id} } |
    And API Operator force succeed created order id "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[1]}" with cod
    And API Operator force succeed created order id "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[2]}" with cod
    Then DB Operator verifies order id "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[1]}" is added to billing_qa_gl.priced_orders
    Then DB Operator verifies order id "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDER_ID[2]}" is added to billing_qa_gl.priced_orders
    Then DB Operator gets ledger details for shipper "{KEY_SHIPPER_ID}" from billing_qa_gl.ledgers table
    Then Operator verifies below details in billing_qa_gl.ledgers table
      | column | expected_value |
      | status | Open           |
    And API Operator trigger reconcile scheduler endpoint
    Then Operator waits for 5 seconds
    And Operator go to menu Finance Tools -> Upload Payments
    When Operator upload CSV on Upload Payments page using data below:
      | shipper_id              | batch_id                         | transaction_event | remittance_date                  | amount   | transaction_number | transaction_type | payment_method   | payee_name   | payee_account_number   | payee_bank   |

    Then Operator verifies csv file is not successfully uploaded on the Upload Payments page
    Then Operator verify Download Error Upload Payment CSV file on Upload Payments Page is downloaded successfully with below data:
      | row | batch_id                         | shipper_id              | message                                                           |
