    And Operator go to menu Station Management Tool -> Station Management Homepage
    And Operator selects the hub as "<HubName>" and proceed
    And Operator closes the modal: "<FSRModalTitle>" if it is displayed on the page
    And Operator verifies that the count in tile: "<TileName>" has increased by 1
    And Operator opens modal pop-up: "<ModalName>" through hamburger button for the tile: "<TileName>"
    And Operator verifies that a table is displayed with following columns:
