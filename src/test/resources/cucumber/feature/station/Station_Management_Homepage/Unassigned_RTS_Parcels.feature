    When DB Station - Operator updates the destination HubId "<DestinationHubId>" in Parcels table for OrderId "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDERS[1].id}"
    And Operator go to menu Station Management Tool -> Station Management Homepage
    And Operator selects the hub as "<HubName>" and proceed
    And Operator verifies that the count in tile: "<TileName>" has increased by 1
    And Operator opens modal pop-up: "<ModalName>" through hamburger button for the tile: "<TileName>"
    And Operator verifies that a table is displayed with following columns:
      | Tracking ID          |
      | Last Scan Type       |
      | Last Scan Time       |
      | Recovery Ticket Type |
      | Ticket Status        |
    And Operator searches for the orders in modal pop-up by applying the following filters:
      | Tracking ID                     |
      | {KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDERS[1].trackingId} |
    And Operator gets the order details from modal "<ModalName>"
    Then Station Operator verifies that Last Scan time for TrackingId "{KEY_LIST_OF_CREATED_ORDERS[1].trackingId}" is +8 hours in station parcels table

    Examples:
      | HubName       | HubId       | DestinationHubId | TileName     | ModalName                           |
